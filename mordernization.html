To be honest, I thought a lot about what to name this chapter. The reason why it was named
modernization is that it was named with the most appropriate title as it describes the contents
focusing on science and technology and modern technology. The modernization chapter
was created to show why modern science and technology should actively participate in this
environmental issue.



1. Residence
Cities journal said that people who live in the center of the city emit less carbon than those
who live in the suburbs. And living outside the city increases carbon emissions per household.
Also, a better way is San Francisco , San Jose, Los Angeles, and San Diego to ease restrictions
on downtown areas. More buildings would reduce average commute times, which could also
reduce carbon emissions per capita. <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/html/green-cities-brown-suburbs-13143.html" target="_blank">It is said that limiting growth will incur higher
environmental costs. Therefore, it stated that it would be best to build more high-rise buildings
rather than the way to the countryside.</a>






2. Food
First of all, let's talk about GMOs in the plant part. GMOs are, so to speak, the salvation
of mankind, not the harm to mankind. Greenpeace is opposed to GMOs. It is the logic of
causing harm. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-54162239" target="_blank">Because of that logic, will it actually become a threat to mankind by destroying
the unsatisfied crops?</a> The picture on the right shows Greenpeace activists destroying
cornfields. I am sorry to Greenpeace, but your fakenews is revealed now. <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/328497307/Laureates-Letter-Supporting-Precision-Agriculture">Several laureates
in medicine, chemistry, physics and ecomoics, who received the 2016 Nobel Prize in medicine,
announced their signatures against Greenpeace's anti-GMO campaign.</a>
<a href="More than 100 Nobel laureates are calling on Greenpeace to end its anti-GMO campaign - Vox">Nobel Laureates Tell Greenpeace "Your anti-GMO campaign has to end". As already said,
Greenpeace has taken a stand against golden rice.</a> <a href="https://leaps.org/we-pioneered-a-technology-to-save-millions-of-poor-children-but-a-worldwide-smear-campaign-has-blocked-it/" target="_blank"> And there is a news name "We pioneered a
Technology to Save Millions of Poor Children, But a Worldwide Smear Campaign Has Blocked It"
</a> However, golden rice has the potential to reduce or eliminate most of the deaths and diseases
caused by vitamin A deficiency (we call that VAD) in Africa and Southeast Asia. For reference,
VAD affects one-third of children under the age of 5 worldwide and is estimated to take the
lives of children under the age of 5 each year.<a href="Vitamin A deficiency - Wikipedia"> In developing countries, it is estimated that
about 250,000-500,000 per year. Thousands of children become blind.</a> Using Greta Thunberg's
words, "HOW DARE YOU, Greenpeace has stolen developing countries children dreams and
childhood" Also, Greenpeace says GMOs are harmful, but as already said, that's a lie.




3. The true about "GMO"
The first GMO was released in 1994, and it was commercialized in 1996. So, it has been about
30 years now. <a href="https://www.nap.edu/html/23395/GE-crops-report-brief.pdf" target="_blank">According to a report published in "the national academies of sciences
engineering and medicine", no risk was found among currently commercial GM plants and
it was reported to be as safe as general crops.</a> Opponents will probably say that there are
papers stating that GMOs are harmful to the human body. There are. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691512005637/?imgSel=Y&_escaped_fragment_=" target="_blank">Representatively, according
to a paper published in 2012 at the University of Caen in France</a>, mice that ate GM corn died
2-3 times faster than mice that did not eat them, and tumors or cancers were also found.
However, regarding this paper, the experimental method was wrong, and the conclusion was
not clear, resulting in withdrawal.Another piece of evidence for the opponents is the Brazil
nut case, developed by an American seed company, which probably actually had side effects.
It introduced a gene called "2s albumin" to develop genetically modified soybeans, which could
cause allergic reactions in people who ate the soybeans. So, it was reviewed to see if it caused
an allergy to soybeans containing "2s albumin", but the original 2s albumin itself was an
allergy-causing substance, so it was not caused by genetic modification, but an allergy to the
original 2s albumin. It was determined that it was caused. So, in simple terms, it is the result
of adding an allergic reaction substance, not the result of the genetic modification process.
<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaq1413">Despite widespread belief among scientists that genetically engineered (GE) foods are safe
to eat, consumers remain less convinced.</a> And now there are numerous pests. Then, pesticides
must be used to catch pests, and other pests or resistance will always appear, which can be
said to be more effective in developing GMOs to remove pests or weeds from the beginning.
And through this, food production increases, which can be seen as a technology that can
overcome the future food crisis.



4. Last text
Humans had a problem of "food shortages" at the end of the 19th century.However, in 1909,
the German chemist Fritz Haberwaka Bosch succeeded in synthesizing ammonia with
nitrogen in the air, creating fertilizers that help plant growth.Thus, the main diet of 45%
of the world's population currently relies on the "Harbour-Bosch method".

For this reason, we need more investment in science and technology.
