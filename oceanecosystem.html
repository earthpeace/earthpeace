Let's start with the mystery of the ocean. The ocean covers more than 70% of the earth.
94% of life on earth is marine, and less than 5% of the earth's ocean has been explored.
Mid-Ocean Ridge, the longest mountain range in the world It is also said to be in water and
less explored than the surface of Venus and Mars. Currently, about 240, 470 species of marine
life have been identified, but only a small fraction of them are known. <a href="https://www.trafalgar.com/real-word/10-unbelievable-facts-ocean/" target="_blank">More than 70% of
Earth's oxygen is produced in the ocean. We live with the ocean, but the marine ecosystem
is being threatened recently.</a>
                                




1. Carbon Types
There are 3 types of carbon.First is black carbon.Second is green carbon. Third is blue carbon.
Black carbon is carbon that causes global warming because it becomes too large. It is the
carbon we often think of. Green carbon is the production of oxygen by plants such as trees
in terrestrial ecosystems by absorbing carbon dioxide. The last is blue carbon. Blue carbon
refers to the carbon absorbed by marine ecosystems such as seaside creatures such as fish
and shellfish halophytes and mangrove forests and tidal flat wetlands. As shown in the picture,
marine ecosystems can absorb more carbon than land ecosystems It has the ability to exist,
but unfortunately, people are unaware of the importance of marine ecosystems.






2. Blue Carbon
Blue carbon has dramatically reduced the size of the ecosystem, with 98,000 to 2.4 million
acres destroyed each year. Since the 1940s and 1990s, up to half of the world's mangrove forests
and seagrass have been lost. This is primarily a result of development, agriculture, pollution
and overfishing.






3. Ocean acidification
Now, let's learn about ocean acidification. First of all, when the ocean becomes
acidic, it is called ocean acidification. The ocean has a property of absorbing carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide flowing into the ocean meets with water to form
carbonic acid. Carbon dioxide dissolved in the sea is released into the atmosphere together
when the seawater evaporates over time. The atmosphere again absorbs carbon dioxide from
the sea and a natural cycle takes place. In this way, the sea has been suppressing the progress
of global warming. Nature continues to circulate the situation to create a healthy global
environment. However, the problem here is that there is too much carbon in the earth's
atmosphere. When carbon dissolves in water, it releases hydrogen ions along with carbonic
acid. If there are more hydrogen ions in the sea, the pH index decreases and the sea becomes
acidic. This phenomenon is called "ocean acidification". Background information on acidity
and basicity. Less than 7 means stronger acidity, and greater than 7 means stronger basicity.
The current sea acidification level is 8.1, and it will get worse in the future.
Since the beginning of the industrial age, the sea has absorbed about 525 billion tons of CO2.
The right photo is a graph showing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the
amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the sea, and the degree of the pH index of the sea.
As carbon dioxide increases, the pH index decreases and acidification proceeds in inverse
proportion. So far, ocean pH has dropped from 8.2 to 8.1 since the industrial revolution,
and is expected by fall another 0.3 to 0.4 pH units by the end of the century. A drop in pH
of 0.1 might not seem like a lot, but the pH scale, like the Richter scale for measuring
earthquakes, is logarithmic. For example, pH 4 is ten times more acidic than pH 5 and 100 times
(10 times 10) more acidic than pH 6. If we continue to add carbon dioxide at current rates,
seawater pH may drop another 120 percent by the end of this century, to 7.8 or 7.7, creating
an ocean more acidic than any seen for the past 20 million years or more.






4. The dangers of ocean acidification
From now on, let's look at the problems of ocean acidification that you want to fundamentally
investigate. Many chemical reactions, including those essential to life, are very sensitive to
even small changes in pH. Normal human blood pH is between 7.35 and 7.45, and a drop in
blood pH of 0.2 to 0.3 can lead to seizures, coma, and even death.
Reef-building corals craft their own homes from calcium carbonate, forming complex reefs
that house the coral animals themselves and provide habitat for many other organisms.
Acidification may limit coral growth by corroding pre-existing coral skeletons while
simultaneously slowing the growth of new ones, and the weaker reefs that result will be more
vulnerable to erosion. In general, shelled animals such as mussels, clams, sea urchins, and
starfish have difficulty forming shells in highly acidic waters such as corals.
Mussels and oysters are expected to grow less shell by 25 percent and 10 percent respectively
by the end of the century. This massive failure isn't universal, however: studies have found
that crustaceans (such as lobsters, crabs, and shrimp) grow even stronger shells under higher
acidity. This may be because their shells are constructed differently.
Additionally, some species may have already adapted to higher acidity or have the ability to do
so, such as purple sea urchins. (Although a new study found that larval urchins have trouble
digesting their food under raised acidity.) Although the fish is then in harmony with its
environment, many of the chemical reactions that take place in its body can be altered. Just
a small change in pH can make a huge difference in survival. Likewise, a fish is also sensitive
to pH and has to put its body into overdrive to bring its chemistry back to normal.
To do so, it will burn extra energy to excrete the excess acid out of its blood through its gills,
kidneys and intestines. <a href="https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/invertebrates/ocean-acidification" target="_blank">It might not seem like this would use a lot of energy, but even a slight
increase reduces the energy a fish has to take care of other tasks, such as digesting food,
swimming rapidly to escape predators or catch food, and reproducing. It can also slow fishes growth.</a>
