1. Problems with solar and wind power
As shown in the graph now, electricity prices in other countries are also on the rise. What
is the cause of this price increase? It is because of the policy to change to new and renewable
energy that Greenpeace insists on. Renewable energy such as wind and solar power is
depending on the situation, energy may be insufficiently produced. If a lot of renewable
energy was installed, the price suddenly rose due to an unstable supply. <a href="https://cwf.ca/research/publications/embracing-nuclear-for-canadas-energy-future-part-two-nuclear-energy-is-cheap-energy/" target="_blank">Electricity prices
vary widely and sometimes even within a country itself, depending on factors like
infrastructure, geography, and politically determined taxes and levies.</a> <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/263492/electricity-prices-in-selected-countries/" target="_blank">In Germany, grid
fees and the renewable surcharge make up nearly half of total electricity prices. German
electricity prices sharply increased in 2012, following the Fukushima nuclear disaster and
the government's swift response in shutting down numerous nuclear reactors.</a> The
installation of new and renewable energy, a policy that everyone calls for carbon neutrality,
rather only contributes to the problem of electricity supply and demand, is not smooth,
and on the contrary, emits more carbon than nuclear power plants. Hydropower, Nuclear
energy, Wind and Solar. These four methods almost do not kill people. And on the contrary,
nuclear power produces less carbon emissions than wind and solar power, and if we really
want to be carbon neutral, we can We will need more help from nuclear power.
In the photo, France uses the most nuclear power plants in the series and produces the
most energy, so France also exports electricity to neighboring countries. However, when
Macron was elected president in 2017, France had 14 out of 58 nuclear power plants. They
said they would shut down the nuclear power, but now they have changed their strategy
to SMR development due to lack of power.

Those photos are Korea photo. Criticism is rising against the government’s push for
renewable energy, with many claiming that government policies are directly responsible
for the devastation of the natural environment across the country. Critics specifically
point at solar generation facilities and wind turbines built in mountainous areas, and solar
panels set up on farms without any consideration for agricultural practices and culture as 
sources of the problem. In fact, ever since the government embarked on a solar power
project to replace nuclear energy, stretches of mountains and forests 15 times larger than
Seoul’s Yeouido Island or 6,000times larger than Seoul World Cup Stadium have been
destroyed over the past three years. Experts argue that solar panels in farmlands were built
without onsideration of the country’s geographic and environmental features.
This photo is the price of electricity for each amount of development. If Greenpeace actually
wants to switch to solar and wind power, we are in a position to pay more and more
electricity in the future. When demand increases when there is a shortage, there may be
a power outage due to insufficient supply. If there is a power outage, the problem that arises
is the lack of electricity at home, and when the life of an emergency patient in the emergency
room or during an operation is at risk, the power outage is a matter of life and death.
Of course, if the wind blows strongly, the electricity cost may be lowered, but since we do
not have the ability to generate wind, it seems like a story of the future. So how to solve all
of this? It is to invest more in nuclear power to achieve technological advancement.
                                                                                        
2. The need for nuclear power                                                
Foratom says the early closure of nuclear would lead to increased CO2 emissions by 2025,
thus hampering the increased 2030 climate mitigation ambition. It would also require new
thermal capacities in order to ensure security of supply, triggering an increase in air pollutants.
"According to the report, not only would the early closure of nuclear power plants trigger
an increase in consumer costs, it will also result in negative environmental impacts," noted
Foratom Director

General Yves Desbazeille. "These include an increase in CO2 emissions and other air pollutants,
higher raw material usage and greater land use impacts." Based on the assessment, Foratom
has identified the following policy recommendations: recognition of the fact that nuclear
energy is an affordable solution which will help the EU to achieve its climate ambitions and
ensure security of supply; avoid the early closure of nuclear power plants as this risks derailing
long-term decarbonisation goals; subject all low-carbon technologies to the same robust
and scientific assessment to ensure a sustainable transition; <a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Report-reinforces-nuclears-role-in-EU-low-carbon-e" target="_blank">develop a market design which
supports all low-carbon technologies; and recognise the contribution of nuclear to a
sustainable hydrogen economy.</a>
<a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/EU-needs-colossal-investment-in-nuclear-to-hit-net" target="_blank">"EU needs 'colossal' investment in new nuclear, says commissioner".</a> This time, let's take a
look at nuclear power plant waste, which Greenpeace calls the problem of nuclear power
plants. It is called Traveling wave reactor, a next-generation reactor by using depleted
uranium as fuel, the new reactor type could reduce stockpiles from uranium enrichment.
TerraPower notes that the US hosts 700,000 metric tons of depleted uranium and that
8 metric tons could power 2.5 million homes for a year.Some reports claim that the high 
fuel efficiency of TWRs, combined with the ability to use uranium recovered from river or
sea water, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TerraPower#Traveling_wave_reactor" target="_blank">means enough fuel is available to generate electricity for 10 billion people at
US per capita consumption levels for million-year time-scales.</a>
                                                                                        
As mentioned above, nuclear power has proven to be advantageous in economic and
environmental aspects compared to renewable energy. So let's talk about the fear of nuclear
power plants that everyone should think about and fear at least once. First, Chernobyl was
an event that could have been avoided in the first place because it was a disaster that
occurred while conducting experiments under the command of Anatoly Dyatlov.
Second, Fukushima was originally an event that occurred as a result of a sea level tsunami
caused by a natural disaster. And while three Tepco employees at the Daiichi and Daini plants
died directly from the earthquake and tsunami, there were no fatalities from the nuclear accident.
                                        
If we truly want to protect the environment, we need more nuclear power plants now.
