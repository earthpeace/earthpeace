<pre id="text">
I believe "Global warming" is true and progressing. And as you read this, you have to admit
that you may be wrong. I also think what I think may be wrong. So, there are a lot of
environmental groups now, but most of them have vaguely defined the end goal. For example,
Greenpeace says they will come with peace.


But what peace? Living together and helping everyone without worry? Or suddenly paragliding
down to the soccer stadium? Fortunately, none any people were injured at that time. Well, it
may be a good purpose, but if that is the real purpose, why do we adjust people's unnecessary
anxiety? Some of you reading this may be bewildered. Unnecessary anxiety? From now on, I
write down the reason why it was created. Unnecessary anxiety should be eliminated. But what
if an organization that claims to eliminate unnecessary anxiety would rather adjust unnecessary
anxiety? That is Greenpeace.





I know you may be wondering. As the first evidence, the comments of experts are probably the
most convincing. <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/sustainable-agriculture/issues/gmos/" target="_blank" id="omg">Greenpeace is opposed to GMOs. </a>This is why Greenpeace is opposed to golden
rice, which can save millions of people, but several <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/06/29/more-than-100-nobel-laureates-take-on-greenpeace-over-gmo-stance/" target="_blank">2016 Nobel Laureates announced that they
should withdraw their opposition to GMOs, saying "Your anti-GMO campaign has to end".</a>










            First, look at the picture left. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/annual-co2-emissions" target="_blank">The country that emits the most carbon dioxide is China.</a> And
            China has been rapidly increasing recently. But I have never heard of Greenpeace protesting
            against China. Rather, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AgzKGv9tUFA" target="_blank">I found a video that Greenpeace supports China.</a>










The second is the movement to ban Chlorine.  <a href=" https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/chlorine-a-dangerous-addition-to-everyday-life/" target="_blank">That's why Greenpeace argues that "Chlorine"
should be banned worldwide.</a> But this is an absurd claim. Chlorine's greatest achievement is
eliminating the bacteria, viruses and parasites that cause water-borne diseases in drinking water.
In North America, chlorine disinfectants were first added to permanent water supplies in 1908.
By the 1920s, thousands of American cities had treated drinking water with chlorine disinfectant.
Waterborne diseases such as typhoid and cholera and infant mortality have been significantly
reduced.If this water is not filtered before adding chlorine, chlorine can react with organic matter
to form chlorine by-products. Although there is some evidence that long-term consumption of
large amounts of chlorine by-products can cause some types of cancer, Health Canada has placed
safety limits for chlorine by-products.At this threshold, your lifetime risk of developing cancer
is extremely low. Chlorine by-products can be suppressed by using source water with an extremely
low organic content (groundwater that is more stable than surface water such as rainwater, rivers,
lakes, etc.) or adding chlorine disinfectant after filtering the water. Chlorine disinfectants are a
proven and effective way to prevent waterborne diseases by treating drinking water. <a href="https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/healthlinkbc-files/drinking-water-chlorination" target="_blank">The extremely
low risk of cancer from long-term exposure to small amounts of chlorine by products does not
outweigh the value of chlorine, which significantly reduces the risk and consequences of waterborne
diseases.</a> If the chlorine ban campaign succeeds, the victims will not be the wealthy who support
Greenpeace. Rich countries and rich people make a hole for themselves whenever they do stupid
things like this. (I'm not meaning rich is wrong) The victims are people living in developing
countries, and they are also the people we are trying to protect.
     

There is much fake news other than the three I just mentioned. And I, who only want accurate
information, make it before I get caught up in fake news and to save you from being deceived
by fake news. We are all people living together in the global village. It is not obligatory to help
others, but harm is an activity that should not be done. The time is now. However, even I who
created this site may be wrong. Therefore, if this site becomes famous, I would like to gather
experts in each field to discuss and discuss the fastest and most effective way to improve
the planet.
