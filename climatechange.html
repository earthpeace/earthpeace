<pre>                                      
Climate change means that the climate is changing. What will happen if the climate changes?
The problems are so numerous that I cannot list them all, but for the sake of the reader's
information, I will list the easy ones that come directly to us.

1. FLOOD AND DROUGHT : First, floods and droughts. First, floods and droughts. Originally,
I was going to explain them separately, but because they are related, they are introduced
together. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaw5531" target="_blank">According to a paper from science advantage in 2019</a>, the current compound flooding
in Europe is "CF should be considered as a potential hazard aggravating the risk caused
by mean sea level rise in the future."(CF is compound flooding) The thesis was published.
So what's the problem when floods appear? Of course, there will be flooding of low-lying
areas, sea level rise, etc. that you thought of. The average global flood loss in 2005 was
estimated at about $6 billion per year, and is projected to rise to $52 billion by 2050 if only
socio-economic changes are anticipated. Current protections must be upgraded to avoid
unacceptable losses of more than US $ 1 trillion per year due to climate change and subsidence.
Even if adaptation investments maintain a  flood probability, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1979" target="_blank">subsidence and sea level rise
will increase global flood losses by US$60-63 billion per year in 2050.</a> River floods are
among some of the costliest natural disasters.using a multi-model framework, we estimate
human losses, direct economic damage and subsequent indirect impacts (welfare losses)
under a range of temperature (1.5 °C, 2 °C and 3 °C warming)3 and socio-economic scenarios,
assuming current vulnerability levels and in the absence of future adaptation. With
temperature increases of 1.5 °C, depending on the socio-economic scenario, it is found that
human losses from flooding could rise by 70–83%, direct flood damage by 160–240%, with
a relative welfare reduction between 0.23 and 0.29%. In a 2 °C world, by contrast, the death
toll is 50% higher, direct economic damage doubles and welfare losses grow to 0.4%. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0257-z" target="_blank">Impacts
are notably higher under 3 C warming, but at the same time, variability between ensemble
members also increases, leading to greater uncertainty regarding flood impacts at higher
warming levels.</a>

2. Tree
Forest mortality is accelerating due to climate change and the largest trees may be at the
greatest risk, threatening critical ecological, economic, and social benefits. Here, we
combine high-resolution airborne LiDAR and optical data to track tree-level mortality
rates for ~2 million trees in California over 8 years, showing that tree height is the strongest
predictor of mortality during extreme drought. Large trees die at twice the rate of small
trees and environmental gradients of temperature, water, and competition control the
intensity of the height-mortality relationship. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12380-6" target="_blank">These findings suggest that future persistent
drought may cause widespread mortality of the largest trees on Earth.</a> <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abb9668" target="_blank ">It states that "drought
food drought is one of the major threats to food security and ecosystem productivity."</a> Of
course, food production is on the rise now, but the population is growing much faster.
<a href="https://news.un.org/en/sites/news.un.org.en/files/legacy-news-images/photos/large/2015/July/Population-Infographic-01.jpg" target="_blank">According to the United Nations, by 2100, the world's population is estimated to be 11.02 billion.</a>







3. SEA LEVEL RISE
Another problem is that sea levels are constantly rising. The image next to it is a graph
image showing the amount of ice in the Arctic. As you can see, the amount is gradually
decreasing, and the decreasing amount is flowing into the sea and the height of the sea is
increasing. Currently, several low-lying areas such as Miami, New Orleans, and Southern
Florida are threatened by seawater inundation. Venice, famous as a maritime city in
Europe, is flooded by several centimeters every year due to sea level problems caused by
global warming and urban aging. For this reason, <a href="https://atlasofthefuture.org/project/mose-project/" target="_blank">the Italian government is working on
the Moses project.</a> When the sea level rises to 1.1 meters, a 10-story sluice barrier called
a flat gate is built. The picture above shows the flooding of the sea level in Tonga.
Due to this phenomenon, many island countries and countries with low elevations are
in danger of being submerged. There are many other countries such as Maldives, Tonga,
Kiribati, Nauru, and Samoa. In Bangladesh, 0.4% of the land is also submerged every year.
Rising is also a problem, but there is another problem. Glaciers originally acted as air
conditioners for the earth by reflecting sunlight, but now, as the area of glaciers decreases,
they absorb sunlight. The problem here is that the sea absorbs sunlight. As it is all received,
the temperature of the earth's sea has risen. The problem is that the temperature of the sea
rises and the volume of the sea expands due to thermal expansion, and the sea level rises as
much as it expands. Simply put, the temperature of the sea rises The rising sea level rises.
I have to say something here. The glacier I am talking about here does not mean that the sea
level floating on the water does not rise. If the glacier existing on the land, not the sea, melts
and flows into the sea, new water from outside flows in, so the sea level will rise.
              















4.Causes of climate change
The above is the result of climate change. Then, before we know the solution, we need
to know why the climate change is happening so that we can know the solution.
First, the temperature rise. The right photo shows the temperature increase so far. The
yellow graph shows the result that the solar activity decreased but the temperature increased
due to solar activity. The phenomenon that occurs when the temperature of the ocean
increases will be dealt with in the "Ocean Ecosystem" part, so I will not discuss it here.
Then, what is the reason for the increase in temperature? The reason is the greenhouse
effect. Of course, the greenhouse effect itself is not bad. If there is no effect, humans will
freeze to death now. But the problem is that the greenhouse effect is now active at a very
serious rate. The gases that cause this greenhouse effect are called greenhouse gases.
These four gases are representative of the greenhouse effect.

    • Water vapor: The most abundant greenhouse gas, but importantly, it acts as a
    feedback to the climate. Water vapor increases as the Earth's atmosphere warms,
    but so does the possibility of clouds and precipitation, making these some of the
    most important feedback mechanisms to the greenhouse effect.

    • Carbon dioxide (CO2): A minor but very important component of the atmosphere,
    carbon dioxide is released through natural processes such as respiration and
    volcano eruptions and through human activities such as deforestation, land use
    changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have increased atmospheric CO2
    concentration by 48% since the Industrial Revolution began. This is the most
    important long-lived "forcing" of climate change.

    • Methane. A hydrocarbon gas produced both through natural sources and human
    activities, including the decomposition of wastes in landfills, agriculture, especially
    rice cultivation, as well as ruminant digestion and manure and management associated
    with domestic livestock. On a molecule-for-molecule basis, methane is a far more
    active greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but also one which is much less abundant
    in the atmosphere.

    • Nitrous oxide. A powerful greenhouse gas produced by soil cultivation practices,
    especially the use of commercial and organic fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric
    acid production, and biomass burning.

    • Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Synthetic compounds entirely of industrial origin used
    in a number of applications, but now largely regulated in production and release to the
    atmosphere by international agreement for their ability to contribute to destruction
    of the ozone layer.

The biggest problem here is CO2.
This right graph is a graph comparing the increase in carbon dioxide and the trend of
increase in temperature. Clearly, as carbon dioxide increases, temperature increases.
It is also a problem that the sea level rises when glaciers melt, but there is also another
problem. The glacier originally acted as an air conditioner for the earth by reflecting
sunlight, but now, as the area of the glacier has decreased, it has absorbed sunlight
as it is.
