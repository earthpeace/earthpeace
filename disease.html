1. Emergence of disease
In the past, diseases appeared every few hundred years to shake the world. The 14th century
Black Death (1347~1351)-Smallpox  (1520~1980)-Spanish Flu (1918~1919)-Asia Flu (1957~1958)
-AIDS (1981), but in the 21st century, SARS (2002~2003)-Shinjongflu (2009~2010)-MERS
(2012~2016)-Corona-2019~) have already shaken the world for 20 years.Scientific works
believe that climate change has contributed to the more frequent outbreak of these diseases.
It is a common infectious disease that can be shared between animals and humans, and it
is estimated that these diseases will be more than 60% of all diseases.This began when humans
began when humans began to tame beasts as civilization progressed. As human history
progresses, the population increases and unexplored lands lead to the loss of the homes of
beasts originally living in the area, which could lead to more frequent outbreaks of common
infectious diseases in the future.In addition, animals often have diseases that we do not
know, and these unnecessary contacts are said to act as a factor that causes more frequent
situations such as COVID-19.









2. The re-emergence of anthrax
The left picture is "Anthrax". Anthrax is the most popular and representative bacterium used
to explain climate change. The most representative example of anthrax is an outbreak in
the frozen ground of Siberia, and it is a lump of carbon because the frozen ground has been
frozen for tens of thousands of years. And it has been frozen for tens of thousands of years.
Because of this, the animals and plants that lived at that time are frozen. There are light
blocking, oxygen blocking, and low temperature conditions that are perfect for viruses to be
preserved, and this is an environment where ancient viruses that lived in the past are stored
to this day. In Siberia due to global warming in 2016. After the heat wave came, the frozen
ground layer thawed, and anthrax bacteria flowed into the water from the carcass of the
reindeer who died from anthrax 75 years ago. <a href="http://siberiantimes.com/other/others/news/n0686-first-anthrax-outbreak-since-1941-9-hospitalised-with-two-feared-to-have-disease/">Among them, there were four children, a total
of nine people were hospitalized, and 1,200 reindeer were also lost.</a>







3. West-Nile-Virus Re-spreading
The left picture is "West-Nile-Virus".
This time, let's look at the resurgence of diseases that were not originally very interested in
due to climate change.The main character of this disease is West Nile virus.The main route
of the West Nile virus is, of course, mosquitoes, and other routes are the "virus" that infects
through stray animals or birds such as horses, crows, and sparrows, causing fatal damage
to the brain.However, West Nile virus is not a new virus.West Nile virus was first discovered
in Uganda in 1937, but was rarely discovered in the next 50years, then appeared in Algeria
and Romania from the 1990s, and appeared in New York in 1999. The final host of the West-
Nile-virus is humans and horses, and surprisingly, there is no vaccine for humans, but
there is a vaccine for speech prevention.About 80% of West Nile virus infected people have
no symptoms.The remaining 20% of infected people suffer from flu-like symptoms
accompanied by vomiting.In addition, about 1% of minor infections develop neurological
diseases including meningitis, encephalitis (brain inflammation), or paralysis. Fortunately,
in general, controlling mosquitoes can control the virus. <a href="https://flatpage-archive.texastribune.org/data/library/west-nile-virus-reports-in-texas/">In 2012, West-Nile-virus occurred 
in northern Texas, and the state government sprayed mosquito repellents to respond
quickly, and 286 of people who died from West Nile virus infection in the United States in
the same year was the highest ever.</a>






4. Last text
Currently, with the emergence of new strains of viruses due to climate change, more and
more viruses are spreading to humans through states such as mosquitoes, birds, and
mammals, and most representative of them are malaria, dengue fever strains, and COVID-19
(SARS-CoV-2).
In the future, the emergence of viruses like this will occur more often.
